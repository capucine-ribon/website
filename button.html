				<center><h2> What is our goal ?</h2>
				<p>
				The creation of this company aims at improving the accessibility to dermatological care for all. The solution is on the internet site and therefore accessible to almost everyone, it corresponds to all ages. Moreover it is a solution that saves money since the concept is to send a photo via the website. The first photo is free to allow new customers to see the quality of the concept. After that, each diagnosis costs 5 euros.  
				 </p> 
				 <br>
				<h3>How does it work ?</h3>
				<p>Once the photo and essential information are sent, they are transferred to professionals (in their last year of study in dermathology or at the beginning of their career) who have time to analyze and give a diagnosis a few hours later. The report can take several forms: the first is in the form of products adapted to your needs that you can find on our site, the second is in the form of a prescription and the third is in the form of a recommendation to make an appointment because the condition is either too serious or impossible to identify. With this, you will of course have all the information explaining your skin problem according to the experts. </p>
				<br>
				<h4>Is there a solution if one has to make an appointment without going through the independent dermatologists ?</h4>
				<p>Yes, we also offer on our sites, all the new dermatologists who have just finished their study and who therefore still have a lot of space and availability for customers depending on your location</p>
				<br>
				<h5>How do we make money?</h5>
				<p>We have made many partnerships with different brands of products that you can find on our sites. It is thanks to them that we can pay the professionals.</p>
				<br>
				<h6>Is there a benefit for the customer to order the products through our site ?</h6>
				<p>Yes, we offer weekly discounts on the most popular products so that everyone can have access to the necessary products.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>What will happen to our photos once they are sent ?</h2> <p>Customers' photos are automatically deleted 24 hours after being sent to the dermatologists. As a website, we never have access to these photos, as they are directly transferred to the dermatologists. This is certified in the privacy policy, which you can find on our website.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Why answer these questions ?</h2>
				<p>In our company values, we want to be as transparent as possible with our customers so that they understand how things work and can then decide if they want to give us their trust. We really want our company to be a safe place for everyone who uses it.</p></center>
